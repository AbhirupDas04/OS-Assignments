## SimpleLoader: Creating an ELF Loader in C from Scratch
This private repository contains the code for a simple Loader for a  ELF 32-bit executable file in C from scratch without the use of any library APIs available for manipulating ELF files. It can compile to a shared library(lib_simpleloader.so) that can be used to load and execute the executable.
